Hi there! I am **Sisir**, born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal. Currently, I am residing in BC, Canada.

Welcome to my personal website. This is the place where you will find stuffs that I write about programming and everything in between.
You will also be able to find other stuff that interests me. I am a _work in progress_ and the contents you find here are of no exception.

> The phrase "I am a work in progress and the contents you find here are of no exception" means that the person speaking or writing is still developing and improving,
and the things that can be found in their space (such as their website or social media profile) are also still evolving and changing.
It suggests that the person is open to growth and learning, and that the things they share may not be perfect or final. - OpenAI's ChatGPT
